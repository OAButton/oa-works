We share our code, content, and data under best practice open licenses. That means our content is CC-BY, our data is CC-0, and our code is under an MIT license.

Materials are made open on the day they're produced, unless they're related to unannounced projects that can't yet be shared.

We currently donâ€™t file software patents. If we do, we will not assert them.
