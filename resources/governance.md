OA.Works is a community-owned nonprofit. Our assets and strategic direction are ultimately controlled by the librarians, researchers, and institutions we serve. As we evolve, we aim to build increasing alignment with the [Principles for Open Infrastructure](https://cameronneylon.net/blog/principles-for-open-scholarly-infrastructures/).

OA.Works is currently incubated by, but separate from, the [Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC)](https://sparcopen.org). SPARC is a global advocacy organization working to make research and education open and equitable by design—for everyone.

Our IP and funding are overseen by the [SPARC Steering Committee](https://sparcopen.org/people/), which would also oversee any change in OA.Work’s legal or organizational structure. This committee is composed of senior North American university leaders representing the 220+ SPARC members.

SPARC is a project of [New Venture Fund (NVF)](https://newventurefund.org/), a 501(c)(3) US public charity that incubates new and innovative public-interest projects and grant-making programs. NVF provides legal and financial control for OA.Works. NVF is a leading fiscal sponsor that manages a charitable portfolio of more than $350 million across over 500 projects.
