Our Vision
## A just and kind information age
We’re striving for a world where information ecosystems are designed and built to reduce inequality, protect human rights, and feel kinder. That can start with opening up how we share research so it’s possible to publish fairly, freely, and quickly while rewriting the rules to include people so often marginalized.

Our Mission
## Build powerfully simple open access tools

Open Access promises equitable information sharing, but we have a long journey ahead to realize it. We build tools that make doing open access equitably easier to help get us there faster. We carefully co-design with libraries, researchers, and educators who’ve always been at the forefront of sharing and shaping public knowledge in the public interest.
