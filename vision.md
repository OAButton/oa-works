title: How we share knowledge just isn’t working.

That’s true for society at large. Fake news threatens our democracies while the world’s biggest companies get rich hoarding our information.

It’s also true for the research community. We’ve built a system where critical discoveries in papers are paywalled, or just can’t be published.

### We’re living in an unkind information age

We’re in an age of information. One where our society is driven not by agriculture, or industrial prowest, but by information. Bits and bytes, not bread or bikes.

It’s not going well. It’s unjust, and it doesn’t have to be. It’s never been easier to share wealth, our yet society is more unequal than ever. It’s unkind, and it doesn't have to be. Winner take all systems tear us apart. Software exploits, not enables us.

### Our vision is a just and kind information age

We want a just information age. One where our society is more prosperous and more healthy. One where our information ecosystem protects our fundamental human rights, rather than threatening them. For the research community, we think that means using openness to make it possible for everyone, everywhere, to use and share research if and how they choose.

A just system is hard to imagine, but we’re pretty sure it would feel kind. And the path towards a just system is long, so we want to pave it with kindness. We think kindness is more powerful than we give it credit for, and we want to use it to alleviate, and lessen burdens while bigger battles about justice are being fought.

These things are possible. We just have to choose to do it and find a place to start.

### We want to start by transforming how we share research to be more open

The research community created the information age, and we think fixing it can start here too.

Researchers created the technology, microchips and the internet, that enable the world around us. But, they also created science and universities, to nurture, fund and put use information to make society better.

And even here, we’ve not made sharing information equitable. Open Access has the promise to, but there’s a long way to go before it does, and at every step we must carefully design it to enable free, fast, and open sharing of research today and address the historical burdens that still weigh us down.

If we do that, research could be open. A core society institution, one that many of our best and brightest work at or move through, might be just and kind.

It’s a path to a just and kind world where the odds are in our favour.

### Our mission is to help by building powerfully simple tools for open access

Day to day, we’re focused on making powerful simple tools for open access. Ones that embody and enable a just and kind world by making the open and equitable choice the easy choice.

We build with libraries, researchers, and educators, who for centuries, we’ve trusted to share and shape knowledge.
