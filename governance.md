OA.Works is a non-profit that's community owned. But this we mean it's assets, and strategic direction, are ultimately controlled by the community it aims to serve.

OA.Works is currently incubated by, but separate from, The [Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition (SPARC)](https://sparcopen.org). SPARC is a global library coalition committed to making Open the default for research and education.

SPARC is a project of [New Venture Fund (NVF)](https://newventurefund.org/), a 501(c)(3) US public charity that incubates new and innovative public-interest projects and grant-making programs. NVF provides legal and financial control for OA.Works. NVF is a leading fiscal sponsor, that at the end of 2019, managed a charitable portfolio of more than $356 million across more than 500 projects.

Our IP and funding are overseen by the [SPARC Steering Committee](https://sparcopen.org/people/), which would also oversee any change in the OA.Workâ€™s legal or organizational structure. This committee represents the 220+ SPARC members and are senior North American university leaders, a space aligned with our mission, and enforces community ownership of our work.

As we evolve, we aim to build increasing alignment with the [Principles for Open Infrastructure](https://cameronneylon.net/blog/principles-for-open-scholarly-infrastructures/).
