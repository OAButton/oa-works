# OA.Works’ Official Site

Powerfully simple open access tools for a just and kind information age.

OA.Works is a non-profit building tools so that open access is easy and equitable. They’re free, open source, and co-designed with advocates for a just world.

Built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)

## Running the site locally

Prerequisites:
[] Running from the command line.
[] Installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/) and [Node Package Manager](https://www.npmjs.com/) or npm.

1. Clone this repository by typing in your terminal:
`git clone https://github.com/oaworks/oa-works.git`

2. Change to its newly created directory: `cd oa-works/`

3. Install Eleventy for this project: `npm install @11ty/eleventy`

4. You can now run the server by entering `npm run dev`. This will also start a `gulp` task that will watch for changes in the preprocessed css and convert them to a minified `main.css` file.

5. Direct your web browser to `http://localhost:8080/`.
