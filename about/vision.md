## *Vision*: A just and kind information age

Weâ€™re striving for a world where information ecosystems get built to reduce inequality, protect human rights, and feel kinder. That can start with opening up how we share research. We want to make publishing fair, free, and open while rewriting the rules to include people too often marginalized.

## *Mission*: Build powerfully simple open access tools

Open Access promised equitable knowledge sharing, but we have a long journey ahead to realize it. To help us get there faster, we build tools that make doing open access equitably easier. We co-design with libraries, researchers, and educators. We trust them as they've always been at the forefront of sharing and shaping public knowledge in the public interest.
