## *Vision*: A just and kind information age

Weâ€™re striving for a world where the information ecosystem reduces inequality, protects human rights, and feels kinder. That starts with opening up how we share research. We want to make publishing fair, free, and open while rewriting the rules to include people too often marginalized.

## *Mission*: Build powerfully simple open access tools

Open Access promised equitable knowledge sharing, but we have a long journey ahead to realize it. To help us get there faster, we build tools that make doing open access equitably easier. We co-design with libraries, researchers, and educators--those at the forefront of shaping and sharing knowledge in the public interest.
