## Hi, weâ€™re so glad youâ€™re here ðŸ‘‹

Societyâ€™s informational (and environmental, political) ecosystems are collapsing. The answers to those problems are paywalled, and most people around the world arenâ€™t even able to share what they know.

Weâ€™re working with libraries, scholars, educators, and the people who fund them to change that. To make sure that academic papers and the research that supports them can be read openly, used easily, and published freely. To make sure that how we share information together is rooted in justice and kindness.

Recently, weâ€™ve built tools like ShareYourPaper.org that makes it simple to freely and legally unlock papers from behind paywalls. Weâ€™ve helped build a new global network of libraries sharing knowledge freely during COVID through RSCVD. Our tools like InstantILL and Open Access Button support libraries and researchers in accessing the research they need without a steep price tag. Theyâ€™ve been used millions of times, across the world.

OA.Works was founded in 2013 in reaction to an obsolete scholarly publishing landscape. But today, behind our work is our small but dedicated team, trusted partners, leading funders, and a strong set of values.

Weâ€™re OA.Works, and thatâ€™s our job, to make Open Access Work.
