      <h3>Our journey</h3>
      <p>In 2013 we started gathering and listening to people’s stories of hitting paywalls. Thousands of stories of information needed and possibilities missed. We wanted to do more than just chronicle the failures of the information age; we wanted to rectify them. So we started building hand in hand with libraries, our guides. We are tirelessly working towards tools that realize the vision of open access through simple design and careful development. We have hope for the future, and we hope the best way to bring it about is to build it.</p>
