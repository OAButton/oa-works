## The early years

In 2013, it wasn’t so clear Open Access would take off. As students, we’d seen paywalls get in the way of our education and our research &mdash; in academia and industry. Powered by frustration, we started the Open Access Button, trying to tell real people’s stories of hitting individual paywalls. Tens of thousands at a time.

We went from late night emails, to hackdays, to an international volunteer team of students and early career librarians across the world. Supported by allies at the Right to Research Coalition, Students for Global Health, and with funding from the Open Societies Foundation we got to work.

Our plans expanded from just chronicling the failures of the information age. We dreamed to join the advocates and leaders working to rectify them. And so, the Open Access Button app got more powerful. We started linking people directly to Open Access versions when we could find them. When we couldn’t, we reached out directly to the scholars behind the paywalls. We shared our users’ stories, and helped them share their work freely.

## Better tools for bigger problems

We found natural allies with librarians. After speaking with more than 100 we were shown an opportunity to shift the gears of the larger system. With Jisc’s support we worked to inject Open Access content into the InterLibrary Loan system, and worked to strengthen it so that libraries could more confidently cancel big deals. We built early tools, guides, and worked with the community at large.

The Arcadia Fund, and our partnership with Tina at IUPUI allowed our work on InterLibrary Loan to be fully realized. We built InstantILL, a frontend for interlibrary loan that can lead to faster and simpler sharing. We built it in order to help put an end to the era of big deals, but it turned out to be just as useful responding to Covid-19.

As we contacted more and more authors, and saw the wider ecosystem focus on paying to publish, we started exploring how we could make self-archiving easier. We spoke to authors, tested approaches, produced novel guides and simple tools. With the Arcadia Fund support (once again), and a partnership with Leila at Montana State, we went further. We made ShareYourPaper.org, the simplest way to self-archive a paper, with the goal of doubling self-archive rates in the next decade.

Along the way our team carefully collated an up-to-date database of sharing permissions that can give immediate insight into the status of 25,000 open access policies.

## Becoming OA.Works

In 2021, our tools got a new home. The organization we called Open Access Button became OA.Works.

## Reflections

Our history isn’t as clear as this story. It’s full of mistakes (see: the Open Data Button or, 373 bugs fixed and counting). Full of moments that mattered we weren’t at the centre of (howdy, Unpaywall). Full of pivot influences from endless people in communities like OpenCon. And that’s great with us, we’re on a journey to a more just and kind world so we expect a few dead ends and love company.

The things that are at the centre of OA.Works and will define our future can be found. Our tools have always tried to make our users’ lives easier today, and change the system tomorrow. We work in partnership with librarians and advocates. We have a clear vision and values, and consistently put them into practice, even if we haven’t known how to express them.
